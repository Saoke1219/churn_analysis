SYRIATEL CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

In Syria, the telecommunications industry faces a significant challenge in retaining customers amidst increasing competition and evolving consumer preferences. SyriaTelcom, one of the leading telecom service providers in the country, seeks to reduce customer churn by identifying patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. High customer churn not only results in revenue loss but also undermines the company's reputation and market position.

Data 

State : Different states of the customers

Account length: number of days a customer's account has been active

Area code : location of the customer

Phone number : customer's phone number

International plan : whether the customer uses the international plan or not

Voice mail plan : whether the customer has subscribed to vmail plan or not

Number vmail messages : if customer has a vmail plan, how many vmail messages do they get

Total day minutes : total number of call minutes used during the day

Total day calls : total number of calls made during the day

Total day charge : total charge on day calls

Total eve minutes : total number of call minutes used in the evening

Total eve calls : total calls made in the evening

Total eve charge : total charge on evening calls

Total night minutes: Total number of call minutes used at night

Total night calls : Total number of night calls

Total night charge : Total charge on night calls

Total intl minutes : total international minutes used

Total intl calls : total number of international calls made

Total intl charge : total charge on international calls

Customer service calls : number of calls made to customer service

Churn : boolean on whether the customer left or not


BUSINESS PROBLEM:

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, aims to proactively address customer churn to retain valuable customers, reduce revenue loss, and enhance overall customer satisfaction and loyalty. To achieve this objective, SyriaTel seeks to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers at risk of churn. By leveraging historical customer data and predictive analytics, SyriaTel aims to anticipate potential churn events and implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate churn and foster long-term customer relationships.

OBJECTIVES:

The objective of this project is to analyze SyriaTelcom's customer data to understand the factors influencing churn and develop predictive models to forecast customer attrition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics, the project aims to:

Identify key features and patterns associated with customer churn and non-churn.

Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of churn for individual subscribers.

Provide actionable insights to SyriaTelcom for implementing targeted retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.

Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing the underlying issues driving churn.

Improve SyriaTelcom's market position and competitiveness in the telecommunications industry by fostering long-term customer relationships.

DATA EXPLORATION

In this analysis, we will be dropping the 'phone number' column as it is a unique identifier for each customer therefore not relevant for analysis. The 'churn' feature serves as the dependent variable.The 'churn' variable signifies whether a customer has terminated their contract with SyriaTel. A value of 'True' means a contract termination, while 'False' indicates that the customer has not terminated their contract and maintains an active account.

![Churn_Distribution](https://github.com/Saoke1219/churn_analysis/assets/144167777/9fe78271-f2d2-4579-a28f-c0a00727a95c)



The above pie chart shows the distribution of churned and non-churned syria tel customers.The distribution is indicated in percentage,with 14.5% "true churn" indicates customers who have ended their subscription. 85.5% "false churn" indicates customers who are still active subscribers.This also shows "non-churn") has a much higher count compared to the other class ("churn"), indicating that the dataset has a class imbalance.

![numerical_distribution_plot](https://github.com/Saoke1219/churn_analysis/assets/144167777/ea29c2c6-b04d-41e3-90e6-e7294875f705)


Above are distribution plots of churned and non-churned customers in the numerical category.We observe that non-churned customers are more than churned customers.we also observe that the distribution is normal while that of total international calls is skewed to the right though still normally distributed.


![numeric_correlation_heatmap](https://github.com/Saoke1219/churn_analysis/assets/144167777/a7b34a79-6976-4b31-b0d7-2f7b477f4b43)


From the correlation heatmap,some of the features in the dataset demonstrate a perfect positive correlation, such as "Total day charge" and "Total day minutes", "Total eve charge" and "Total eve minutes", "Total night charge" and "Total night minutes", and "Total int charge" and "Total int minutes".They have a correlation coefficient of 1.00, indicating perfect multicollinearity.

DISTRIBUTION OF CATEGORICAL VARIABLES

![voice_mail_plan_count_on_churn](https://github.com/Saoke1219/churn_analysis/assets/144167777/4141d0b3-1499-409a-a7dc-d8fc8ab594a9)

We can observe from the plot above that there is a significantly low churn rate among customers with a voicemail plan.
This indicates customers have a preference of using this plan.



![international_plan_by_churn_status](https://github.com/Saoke1219/churn_analysis/assets/144167777/3b62b438-fe73-49d8-8bfa-2a30acba0bc7)

We have a small number of customers with an international plan howerver we observe a high churn rate among this group.Possible reasons for the high churn rate could be dissatisfaction with the international plan, international plan charges.

DATA PREPROCESSING AND PREPARATION

Transform "churn"column from true and false to 0s and 1s.

new_df2['churn'] = new_df2['churn'].map({True: 1, False: 0}).astype('int')

new_df2.head()

ONE-HOT ENCODING CATEGORICAL FEATURES

To be able to run a classification model categorical features are transformed into dummy variable values of 0 and 1.


dummy_df2_state = pd.get_dummies(new_df2["state"],dtype=np.int64,prefix="state_is")
dummy_df2_area_code = pd.get_dummies(new_df2["area code"],dtype=np.int64,prefix="area_code_is")
dummy_df2_international_plan = pd.get_dummies(new_df2["international plan"],dtype=np.int64,prefix="international_plan_is",drop_first = True)
dummy_df2_voice_mail_plan = pd.get_dummies(new_df2["voice mail plan"],dtype=np.int64,prefix="voice_mail_plan_is",drop_first = True)


new_df2 = pd.concat([new_df2,dummy_df2_state,dummy_df2_area_code,dummy_df2_international_plan,dummy_df2_voice_mail_plan],axis=1)
new_df2 = new_df2.loc[:,~new_df2.columns.duplicated()]
new_df2 = new_df2.drop(['state','area code','international plan','voice mail plan'],axis=1)


SCALING NUMERICAL FEATURE

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
def scaling(columns):

    return scaler.fit_transform(new_df2[columns].values.reshape(-1,1))

for i in new_df2.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns:

    new_df2[i] = scaling(i)
    
new_df2.head()


FEATURE SCALING & TRAINING

# create the X and Y variables (predict and target values)

y = new_df2['churn']

X = new_df2.drop(['churn'], axis=1) 

#split data into train and test sets

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

print("X_train shape:", X_train.shape)

print("X_test shape:", X_test.shape)

print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)

print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)


SMOTE

SMOTE is a data resampling technique used to address class imbalance by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.In this case our minority is churned.

#smote is used to address class imbalance in machine learning

from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

oversample = SMOTE(k_neighbors=5)

X_smote, y_smote = oversample.fit_resample(X, y)

print(y_smote.value_counts())
